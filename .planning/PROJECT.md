# HelixAI

## What This Is

An AI-powered tone consultant that interviews guitarists about the sound they're after — an artist, a song, a genre, a vibe, or their existing physical rig — then generates a downloadable preset file for Line 6 Helix LT, Helix Floor, and Pod Go. Presets must be world-class: mix-ready out of the box, dynamically responsive to playing, and built with the same signal chain intelligence as paid professional presets.

## Core Value

Generated presets must sound professional enough to compete with custom presets that people pay experts for — not "decent starting points" but genuinely great tones that sit in a mix immediately.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Chat-based tone interview flow — v1.0
- ✓ .hlx file generation that loads on Helix LT/Floor — v1.0

- ✓ Rig emulation for Helix LT, Helix Floor, and Pod Go — v1.3

### Active

- [ ] Google authentication with anonymous-first flow (login unlocks persistence)
- [ ] Chat persistence — full conversation history stored per user in cloud database
- [ ] Last-preset storage — most recent .hlx/.pgp saved per conversation
- [ ] Chat sidebar UI — pull-out panel listing past chats, like ChatGPT/Claude
- [ ] Resume conversations — re-open a chat, continue refining, regenerate with tweaks
- [ ] Anonymous usage remains fully functional without login

### Out of Scope

- HX Stomp support — different hardware constraints, defer to future
- MIDI configuration — focus on tone, not hardware routing
- IR (impulse response) loading — stick with stock cabs
- Multi-provider comparison UI — going single provider for quality focus
- Full pedalboard OCR (auto-detect all pedals from a single board photo) — too unreliable at launch, per-pedal photos are the baseline

## Current Milestone: v2.0 Persistent Chat Platform

**Goal:** Transform HelixAI from a stateless generate-and-download tool into a persistent platform where users log in with Google, maintain a sidebar of past conversations, pick up where they left off, and re-download their most recent preset per chat. Anonymous usage remains fully functional; login unlocks history.

**Target features:**
- Google authentication (anonymous-first, login unlocks persistence)
- Chat persistence (full conversation history stored per user in cloud database)
- Last-preset storage (most recent .hlx/.pgp file saved per conversation)
- Chat sidebar UI (pull-out panel, list of past chats, like ChatGPT/Claude)
- Resume conversations (continue refining, regenerate with tweaks)
- New chat creation from sidebar
- Anonymous flow unchanged — generate and download without an account

## Context

v1.0 rebuilt the entire preset engine from scratch: type contracts, Knowledge Layer (chain rules, param engine, snapshot engine), AI integration with Claude Sonnet 4.6 structured output, end-to-end orchestration, frontend polish, and hardening.

v1.1 fixed hardware-facing bugs, added prompt caching, genre-aware effect defaults, smarter snapshot toggling, and signal chain visualization.

v1.2 added full Pod Go support: .pgp format, Mono/Stereo model catalog, device-aware chain rules, and Pod Go in the device selector.

v1.3 added rig emulation: Claude Vision pedal extraction, 53-entry curated mapping table, text rig parsing, substitution card UI, and progressive loading states. Works for all three devices.

Key architecture: Planner-Executor pattern where Claude selects creative model choices (~15 fields in ToneIntent) and the deterministic Knowledge Layer generates all parameter values. This separation ensures tone quality is encoded in code, not dependent on AI accuracy.

The app is currently stateless — every page load starts fresh, no user identity, no saved chats. v2.0 adds a persistence layer (auth, database, file storage) and a chat management UI while preserving the existing anonymous generate-and-download flow for non-authenticated users.

## Constraints

- **Hardware**: Line 6 Helix LT, Helix Floor, Pod Go — specific file formats (.hlx, .pgp)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (free tier), serverless functions for AI calls — image payload size matters
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, keep Warm Analog Studio design
- **AI Provider**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 — supports vision input natively (base64 images in messages API)
- **Image limits**: Vercel serverless body limit ~4.5MB — must validate/compress uploads client-side
- **Mapping quality**: Physical pedal → Helix model mapping must be curated, not guessed — encyclopedic knowledge of guitar gear required

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Full rebuild over incremental fixes | Current preset engine is fundamentally mid — patching won't get to world-class | ✓ Good |
| Single AI provider (Claude Sonnet 4.6) | Focus produces better results than spreading across 3 providers | ✓ Good |
| Helix LT + Floor over LT-only | Same .hlx format, no extra work, bigger audience | ✓ Good |
| Keep Warm Analog Studio frontend | Design is strong, just needs polish — no reason to throw it away | ✓ Good |
| Planner-Executor architecture | AI selects models (~15 fields), Knowledge Layer generates all params deterministically | ✓ Good |
| Pod Go as v1.2 (not v2.0) | Building on existing architecture, not replacing — new device is additive | ✓ Good |
| Rig emulation as part of the tone interview | No new mode — the chat detects rig descriptions and switches into emulation mode naturally | ✓ Good |
| Per-pedal photos over full pedalboard OCR | Per-pedal is reliable; whole-board OCR too error-prone for v1.3 | ✓ Good |
| Reverse "no user accounts" for v2.0 | Product matured enough that persistence adds clear user value — users want to iterate on presets | — Pending |
| Anonymous-first auth model | Non-logged-in users get full functionality; login unlocks persistence only | — Pending |
| Save last preset per chat (not all versions) | Balance between utility and storage cost — one .hlx/.pgp per conversation | — Pending |
| Auth/database/storage provider TBD | Firebase, Supabase, or best fit — research phase will determine | — Pending |
